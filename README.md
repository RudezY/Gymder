# GYMDER 
Project 2 

# Description 
With this project we wanted to create an application for users that don't have a consistent gym partner or at least give users the ability to find a new gym partner in their local area. The users are brought to a login page where they are presented the options to log into their account or to sign up for one. After signing up or signing in, the user is then given several zipcodes [Or they would input a zipcode/Gym] and gym to which the user will then be given a variety of other matching partners to choose from. 

#Deployed Site: 

[Upload Image of Homepage] 

#Usage: 

1. The user is brought to a sign in page where they can choose to login to an account they've made or to sign up for one 
[Upload Pictures of Sign in / Homepage / Zipcode(Cities) / Gyms & Written Instructions] 

2. Here is the homepage where the user can select (or type in a zipcode) that directs them to a city that is linked to that ID 

3. After selecting their city, the user is brought into another page where they will select a gym of their choice. 

4. A page will populate with other users that match the original users parameters.
